Welcome to the project of face recognition To get started, you have to follow these steps mentioned below.

1) Choose five images with your face only.
2) Rename them as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 (You can choose alphabets too but keep the name string as short as possible).
3) Create a folder of your name, and put all the images inside it.
4) Now copy the folder andpaste it inside the image folder of the project. (If not found, just create a folder named "images" inside the      project folder.
5) Run training.py to store your face data.
6) Run index.py to scan and recognize your face.

Note: Since it is not based on the deep learning completely, it might not show your name.
      please use a good quality webcam.
